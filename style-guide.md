# Style Guide

- Please use `stylish-haskell` on the project to keep imports consistent and
  clean. We have a custom [`.stylish-haskell.yaml`](.stylish-haskell.yaml) file.
  You can run `stylish-haskell` from vim with `:%! stylish-haskell`.
- Four space indent.
- Prefer indentation over any other form of alignment.
- If text goes off the screen due to four space indentation, factor out
  functions and values into names to reduce indentation.
