# Esqueleto, a SQL DSL for Haskell

Esqueleto is a bare bones, type-safe EDSL for SQL queries that works with unmodified persistent SQL backends. The name of this library means "skeleton" in Portuguese and contains all three SQL letters in the correct order =). It was inspired by Scala's Squeryl but created from scratch. Its language closely resembles SQL. Currently, SELECTs, UPDATEs, INSERTs and DELETEs are supported.

In particular, esqueleto is the recommended library for type-safe JOINs on persistent SQL backends. (The alternative is using raw SQL, but that's error prone and does not offer any composability.). For more information read [esqueleto](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/esqueleto).

## Setup

If you're already using `persistent`, then you're ready to use `esqueleto`, no further setup is needed.  If you're just starting a new project and would like to use `esqueleto`, take a look at `persistent`'s [book](http://www.yesodweb.com/book/persistent) first to learn how to define your schema.

If you need to use `persistent`'s default support for queries as well, either import it qualified:

```haskell
-- For a module that mostly uses esqueleto.
import Database.Esqueleto
import qualified Database.Persistent as P
```

or import `esqueleto` itself qualified:

```haskell
-- For a module that uses esqueleto just on some queries.
import Database.Persistent
import qualified Database.Esqueleto as E
```

Other than identifier name clashes, `esqueleto` does not conflict with `persistent` in any way.


## Goals

The main goals of `esqueleto` are:

- Be easily translatable to SQL. (You should be able to know exactly how the SQL query will end up.)
- Support the most widely used SQL features.
- Be as type-safe as possible.

It is _not_ a goal to be able to write portable SQL. We do not try to hide the differences between DBMSs from you


## Introduction

For the following examples, we'll use this example schema:

```haskell
share [mkPersist sqlSettings, mkMigrate "migrateAll"] [persist|
  Person
    name String
    age Int Maybe
    deriving Eq Show
  BlogPost
    title String
    authorId PersonId
    deriving Eq Show
  Follow
    follower PersonId
    followed PersonId
    deriving Eq Show
|]
```

## Select

Most of `esqueleto` was created with `SELECT` statements in mind, not only because they're the most common but also because they're the most complex kind of statement.  The most simple kind of `SELECT` would be:

```haskell
putPersons :: SqlPersist m ()
putPersons = do
  people <- select $
              from $ \person -> do
              return person
  liftIO $ mapM_ (putStrLn . personName . entityVal) people
```

which generates this SQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Person
```

`esqueleto` knows that we want an `Entity Person` just because of the `personName` that is printed.

## Where

Filtering by `PersonName`:

```haskell
select $
from $ \p -> do
where_ (p ^. PersonName ==. val "John")
return p
```

which generates this SQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Person
WHERE Person.name = "John"
```

The `(^.)` operator is used to project a field from an entity. The field name is the same one generated by `persistent`s Template Haskell functions.  We use `val` to lift a constant Haskell value into the SQL query.

Another example:

In `esqueleto`, we may write the same query above as:

```haskell
select $
from $ \p -> do
where_ (p ^. PersonAge >=. just (val 18))
return p
```

which generates this SQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Person
WHERE Person.age >= 18
```

Since `age` is an optional `Person` field, we use `just` to lift`val 18 :: SqlExpr (Value Int)` into `just (val 18) ::SqlExpr (Value (Maybe Int))`.

## Joins

Implicit joins are represented by tuples.

For example, to get the list of all blog posts and their authors, we could write:

```haskell
select $
from $ \(b, p) -> do
where_ (b ^. BlogPostAuthorId ==. p ^. PersonId)
orderBy [asc (b ^. BlogPostTitle)]
return (b, p)
```

which generates this SQL:

```sql
SELECT BlogPost.*, Person.*
FROM BlogPost, Person
WHERE BlogPost.authorId = Person.id
ORDER BY BlogPost.title ASC
```


However, you may want your results to include people who don't have any blog posts as well using a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`:

```haskell
select $
from $ \(p `LeftOuterJoin`` mb) -> do
on (p ^. PersonId ==. mb ?. BlogPostAuthorId)
orderBy [asc (p ^. PersonName), asc (mb ?. BlogPostTitle)]
return (p, mb)
```

which generates this SQL:

```sql
SELECT Person.*, BlogPost.*
FROM Person LEFT OUTER JOIN BlogPost
ON Person.id = BlogPost.authorId
ORDER BY Person.name ASC, BlogPost.title ASC
```

## Left Outer Join

On a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` the entity on the right hand side may not exist (i.e. there may be a `Person` without any `BlogPost`s), so while `p :: SqlExpr (Entity Person)`, we have `mb :: SqlExpr (Maybe (Entity BlogPost))`.  The whole expression above has type `SqlPersist m [(Entity Person, Maybe (Entity BlogPost))]`.  Instead of using `(^.)`, we used `(?.)` to project a field from a `Maybe (Entity a)`.

We are by no means limited to joins of two tables, nor by joins of different tables.  For example, we may want a list of the `Follow` entity:

```haskell
select $
from $ \(p1 `InnerJoin` f `InnerJoin` p2) -> do
on (p2 ^. PersonId ==. f ^. FollowFollowed)
on (p1 ^. PersonId ==. f ^. FollowFollower)
return (p1, f, p2)
```

which generates this SQL:

```sql
SELECT P1.*, Follow.*, P2.*
FROM Person AS P1
INNER JOIN Follow ON P1.id = Follow.follower
INNER JOIN Person AS P2 ON P2.id = Follow.followed
```

Note carefully that the order of the ON clauses is reversed! You're required to write your `on`s in reverse order because that helps composability (see the documentation of `on` for more details). 

## Update and Delete

```haskell
do update $ \p -> do
     set p [ PersonName =. val "JoÃ£o" ]
     where_ (p ^. PersonName ==. val "Joao")
   delete $
     from $ \p -> do
     where_ (p ^. PersonAge <. just (val 14))
```

The results of queries can also be used for insertions. In `SQL`, we might write the following, inserting a new blog post for every user:

```haskell
 insertSelect $ from $ \p->
 return $ BlogPost <# "Group Blog Post" <&> (p ^. PersonId)
```

which generates this SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO BlogPost
SELECT ('Group Blog Post', id)
FROM Person
```

Individual insertions can be performed through Persistent's `insert` function, reexported for convenience.

### Re-exports

We re-export many symbols from `persistent` for convenience:
- "Store functions" from "Database.Persist".
- Everything from "Database.Persist.Class" except for `PersistQuery` and `delete` (use `deleteKey` instead).
- Everything from "Database.Persist.Types" except for `Update`, `SelectOpt`, `BackendSpecificFilter` and `Filter`.
- Everything from "Database.Persist.Sql" except for `deleteWhereCount` and `updateWhereCount`.

### RDBMS Specific

There are many differences between SQL syntax and functions supported by different RDBMSs.  Since version 2.2.8, `esqueleto` includes modules containing functions that are specific to a given RDBMS.

- PostgreSQL: `Database.Esqueleto.PostgreSQL`

In order to use these functions, you need to explicitly import their corresponding modules.


### Tests and Postgres

To ```stack test``` with Postgresql you'll need to set the Postgres flag for [esqueleto.cabal](esqueleto.cabal)
Do this from the command line with: ```stack test --flag esqueleto:postgresql```

If you don't have Postgres install it. 
Using apt-get it's just:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

Using homebrew on OSx 

```
brew install postgresql
brew install libpq
```

Detailed instructions on the Postgres wiki [here](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)

The connection details are located near the bottom of the [test/PostgreSQL/Test.hs](test/PostgreSQL/Test.hs) file:

```
withConn =
  R.runResourceT . withPostgresqlConn "host=localhost port=5432 user=esqutest password=esqutest dbname=esqutest"
```

You can change these if you like but to just get them working set up as follows on linux:

```$ sudo -u postgres createuser esqutest```

```$ sudo -u postgres createdb esqutest```

```
$ sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# \password esqutest
```


And on osx

```$ createuser esqutest```

```$ createdb esqutest```

```
$ psql postgres
postgres=# \password esqutest
```


Now ```stack build --fast --test esqueleto:test:postgresql``` should invoke and pass all the Postgres tests.
